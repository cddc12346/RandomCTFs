# Chapter 4 - Threads

## Things that I never knew

1) Optional stack size

2) CreateRemoteThread is a common technique for debugger to force a break in debugged process
	- Also use to obtain internal information about another process
	
3) CreateThread and CreateRemoteThread eventually calls CreateRemoteThreadEx and NtCreateThreadEx
	- NtCreateThreadEx will trainsit into kernel mode

4) Creating a thread in kernel mode is achieved with the PsCreateSystemThread (can create thread in ANY process)

5) Windows thread is represented by an executive thread object 
	- ETHREAD structure
	- KTHREAD structure
	
6) ETHREAD structure exists in system address space, while TEB exists in process address space
![plot](./Images/ETHREAD.PNG)

	- Interesting fields:
		1) Process this thread belongs to -> EPROCESS
		2) Access Token
		3) Pending I/O Requests points to IRP
		4) ETHREAD -> Thread List Entry -> ETHREAD
	
	- First member is called TCB (actually a structure of type KTHREAD)
	- ***Process Identification Information***
		- ***Stores a pointer to the owning process***

7) KTHREAD structure
![plot](./Images/KTHREAD.PNG)


	- Interesting fields:
		1) Dispatcher Header
		2) ***TEB (In Userland)***
		3) Wait Block
		4) List of pending APCs
		5) KTHREAD -> Thread List Entry -> KTHREAD
		
	- KTHREAD structure contains information that the windows kernel need to perform:
		1) Thread scheduling
		2) Synchronization
		3) Time-keeping
		
8) Thread Scheduling 
	- Ranges from 0 to 31 (highest)
	- Priority 0 for zero page thread 
	- 1  - 15 = Dynamic
	- 16 - 31 = Real-Time
	
9) Thread priority are assigned from 2 different perspectives (From Windows API and from Kernel)
	
10) Thread states
	- Ready
	- Deferred ready
	
# IRPS

1) There is a pointer to the userbuffer member in the IRP.
This userbuffer is accessed using routines (Buffered I/O and Direct I/O)

- Buffered I/O
Allocate data in kernel ***non paged pool*** -> Read from RAM -> Copy to user buffer 

- For write operations, the I/O Manager copies the caller's buffer data into the allocated buffer when ***creating the IRP***.
- For read operations, the I/O Manager copies data from the allocated bufffer to the user's buffer when the ***IRP completes***.

2) Structure of IRP
![plot](./Images/IRP.PNG)

There are some interesting members in the structure!!!

3) I/O Stack Locations
When an IRP is created, the number of requested I/O Stack Locations is passed to IoAllocateIRP.

4) While active, each IRP is usually queued in an IRP list associated with the thread that requested the I/O.
This allows the I/O system to find and cancel any outstanding IRPs if a thread terminated with I/O requests that are not completed.
***!thread can reveal any outstanding IRPs***

***5) Does the IRP size depends on the device object, upper filters, failed request????***

6) A driver that receives an IRP can do a few things:
- Complete the IRP by calling IoCompleteRequest. This could be due to invalid parameters!! Driver will call IoGetCurrentIrpStackLocation to get a pointer to the stack location it should refer to.
- Forward the IRP to the next layer by calling IoCallDriver. In this stage, the driver at this layer will need to prepare the pointer to the IO Stack location.
- Register completion routine (IoSetCompletionRoutine). After IoCompleteRequest is called by a lower layer driver, the IRP travels up calling any completion routine. The IRP originator uses this mechanism to do any post IRP processing and finally free the IRP.

7) Searching for uncompleted IRP with ***!irpfind and !irp [address]*** 

# Useful commands
1) dt nt!_ETHREAD
2) dt nt!_KTHREAD
3) !process 
	- !process 0 0 explorer.exe
	- !process ffffe00018C817C0 2 (This shows its thread)
4) !thread
5) !TEB
6) ~(tilde) (show all threads in the process)
7) dt ntdll!_teb {address}
***8) .thread /p {address} (Switches context to thread)***

## Objects size always look different from what is on the pool
The output will start with a pool header
dt _POOL_HEADER fffffa8005ae72c0

It is worth noting that when looking at the size of a _KENLISTMENT chunk on the pool, it wonâ€™t directly match the size of the _KENLISTMENT structure, and this is because the structure is a kernel Object and is thus wrapped in additional structures. For instance, on most versions of Windows the _KENLISTMENT allocation has both an OBJECT_HEADER and OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO.
## Objects are wrapped in additional windows structures

1) _POOL_HEADER (0x10)
2) _OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO (0x20)
3) _OBJECT_HEADER (0x30)
4) _KENLISTMENT (actual object)

# Read/Write candidates
ObfDereferenceObject()
KeReleaseMutex() -> KeReleaseMutant() -> KiTryUnwaitThread()

# What can u do with an arbitary increment primitive?
Problems with it = need to know the starting value in order to set it to what we want
So, hopefully be able to initialize a structure with the initial value = 0

1) Slide 34, Splitting Pool Chunks
	- In a free pool page, the first chunk is allocated at the front
	- Subsequent allocations are allocated starting from the end
	- Using this theory, probably can control where to locate your objects

2) PoolIndex overwrite (Overwriting pool header of another page?)

3) Quota Process Pointer Overwrite (Decrement primitive?)
