Fastbin attack concept:
Allocate a few fastbin of size 0x20

Allocate a chunk in smallbin of size 0x80

Overwrite a pointer to fastbin so that the 
second reallocation will be allocated on top of the smallbin chunk
- Need to ensure smallbin size is set to 0x20 before allocating else there will be error

To get libc leak, free the smallbin
- Restore the size of smallbin first before free if not it will be placed into fastbin

Use fastbin attack to place address of libc, so malloc returns this libc address
overwrite __malloc_hook which is a function pointer that malloc calls when it is not null

__malloc_hook size is very huge. way past fastbin sizes
we just misalign  it to get 0x7f at the size area
